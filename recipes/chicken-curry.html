        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>

            <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.            </li>
            <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.            </li>
            <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
